            <h1> The Genesis </h1>
            <p>Osman I becomes the leader, later known as sultan, of the Turkish
              tribes in Anatolia. The tribe will become known as the Ottoman
              Turks.</p>

            <p>Osman I and his army celebrate after they lay siege to Bursa, a
              city in northwest Turkey, and made it the Ottoman Empire's
              capital. Osman I died this same year.</p>

            <h1> Young and Victorious </h1>
            <p>The 21-year-old sultan Mehmed II lays siege to Constantinople,
              the Byzantine empire's capital, and after eight weeks of intense
              fighting, the Ottoman Empire comes out victorious. Renamed
              Istanbul, the city becomes a cultural, economic, and political
              mecca for the Ottoman Empire. There is also a new and unique tax
              that is imposed on non-Muslim residents. </p>

            <p>The Ottoman sultan Selim I, known as Selim the Grim, captures
              Cairo, conquers Egypt, and ends Mameluke rule in the middle
              east.</p>

            <h1> A Magnificent </h1>
            <p> Sultan Suleyman I, known as Suleyman the Magnificent, rises to
              power and conquers parts of southeast Europe and western Asia in
              his conquest to convert people to Islam. The Ottoman empire peaked
              under Suleyman I rule, and he is remembered as one of the most
              infamous and powerful sultans.</p>

            <h1> The Begining of a Long Ending </h1>
            <p> Unlike his father, Suleyman I, Selim II is cowardly and
              disorganized. Under his reign, the Ottomans failed to conquer the
              Venetian island of Cyprus during the Battle of Lepanto. Spanish
              and Venetian galleys demolished the Turkish fleet.
              The slow decline of the Ottoman Empire begins. </p>

            <h1> A Loss of Superiority </h1>
            <p> The Ottomans lead an expedition against emperor Leopold I and
              try to conquer Vienna. The Ottomans are defeated by the combined
              force of Leopold I and John III Sobieski of Poland, marking the
              end of the Turkish superiority in eastern Europe.</p>

            <h1> Forced to Peace </h1>
            <p> Austrian troops push into Ottoman territory in Hungary, defeat
              the Turks at Zenta, and force the Ottoman empire to give up land
              in that region to keep the peace. </p>

            <h1> Meddling in Affairs </h1>
            <p> The treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji is signed, and the Ottoman empire
              secedes Crimea to Russia, ending the Russo-Turkish War. The
              conclusion of the Ottoman's undisputed control of the Black Sea
              gives Russia a diplomatic basis for any future intervention in the
              Ottoman Empires' internal affairs. </p>

            <h1> Greece is Back </h1>
            <p> Greece begins to rebel against the Ottomans and eventually gets
              help from Britain, France, and Russia. Greece wins its
              independence in 1830. </p>

            <h1> Losing More </h1>
            <p> The Congress of Berlin is signed replacing the Treaty of San
              Stefano, which was signed at the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish
              War. The treaty acknowledges the independence of Serbia, Romania,
              Montenegro, and Bulgaria freeing them from the Ottoman Empire.</p>

           <h1> Fin </h1>
           <p> Post-Balkan War, the Ottoman Empire sides with the Central Powers
             during World War I, and they lose the war. Peace treaties cause the
             Ottoman Empire to dissolve, and the Republic of Turkey is established
             in 1923.</p>
