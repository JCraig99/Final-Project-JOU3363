        <h2> Death Race </h2>
        <p> In the Ottoman Empire, the Sultans head gardener, known as the
          <i>bostancı basha</i>, doubled as his executioner. When high-ranking
          officials, such as the sultan’s vizier, were sentenced to death, the
          <i>bostancı basha</i> would personally deal with it. Toward the end of the
          sultans’ rule, a curious custom arose. The man who was convicted and
          the <i>bostancı basha</i> would compete in a race of life or death. If the
          official being executed could make it from the Topkapi Palace to the
          Fish Market Gates before the <i>bostancı basha</i>, he was allowed to live.
          But more often than not, the <i>bostancı basha</i> would win, and the
          convicted contestant would be executed and his body thrown into the
          sea.</p>

        <h2> The Law of Fratricide </h2>
        <p> The Ottoman Empire's sultans did not practice primogeniture, where the eldest son inherits everything. Often, various brothers or men related to the sultan claimed the throne murdered each other for power. So, When Mehemed the Conqueror took the throne, he had the vast majority of his male relatives executed, including his infant brother. Later, he formalized a long-standing practice by issuing his notoriously brutal law know as The Law of Fratricide. The law read, "The majority of legists have declared that those of my illustrious children and grandchildren who shall ascend the throne shall have the right to execute their brothers."</p>

        <h2> The Imoerial Harem </h2>
        <p> In the Topkapi Palace there was the Imperial Harem. The harem was made of up women who were mostly either bought or abducted and they surved the sultan. The women organized into a hierarchy, established based on skills learned and the amount of attention the sultan gave a woman. While some hardly saw the sultan while other managed to gain his favor and gain influence. The most sought after titles were the <i> haseki </i>, the sultans favorite concubine, and the <i> valide sultan </i>, the mother of the sultan. Often the <i> haseki </i> would become the <i> valide sultan </i>.
